# 🧮 Expression Calculator & Equation Solver
**Category:** Tools & Utilities | **Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Status:** 📋 Planned

---

## 📌 Overview
Type any math expression like:

(3+4)*2^3 - sqrt(16)

and get the result instantly.

Supports variables, mathematical functions, operator precedence, and equation solving.

This project focuses on parsing, tokenizing, and implementing expression evaluation algorithms from scratch.

- Variable assignment:
  - `x = 5`
  - `x * 2`
- Equation solver:
  - `2x + 4 = 10`
- Unit conversion (km to miles, etc.)
- History of calculations
