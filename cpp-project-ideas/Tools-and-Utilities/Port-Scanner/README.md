# 🌐 Port Scanner & Network Utility
**Category:** Tools & Utilities | **Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Status:** 📋 Planned

---

## 📌 Overview
Scan open ports on any host, ping IPs, measure latency, and detect services running on specific ports.

A lightweight network diagnostic tool built from scratch.

This project focuses on socket programming, TCP/IP fundamentals, and multithreaded network operations.

---

## ✨ Features
- Scan port ranges on any IP/hostname
- Detect open / closed / filtered ports
- Identify common services (HTTP, FTP, SSH)
- Ping host and measure latency
- Multi-threaded scanning for speed
- Export scan results to file
- Banner grabbing for service detection
