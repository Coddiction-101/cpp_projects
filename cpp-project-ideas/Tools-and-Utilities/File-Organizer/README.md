# 📁 File Organizer
**Category:** Tools & Utilities | **Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐ | **Status:** 🔨 In Progress

---

## 📌 Overview
Scans a target folder and automatically sorts files into categorized subfolders by type. Detects duplicates, generates an organization report, and supports undo functionality.

This project is focused on mastering modern C++ filesystem handling and recursive directory traversal.

## ✨ Features
- Auto-sort files into:
  - Images
  - Videos
  - Documents
  - Code
  - Audio
  - Archives
  - Others
- Duplicate file detection and reporting
- Organization summary report
- Undo last organization
- File rename cleaner (removes spaces & special characters)

## 🧠 Concepts Required

| Concept | Familiar? |
|---------|----------|
| OOP, Vectors, Maps, File I/O | ✅ Yes |
| `<filesystem>` library (C++17) | 🆕 New |
| Recursive directory traversal | 🆕 New |

---

## 🚧 Build Status
