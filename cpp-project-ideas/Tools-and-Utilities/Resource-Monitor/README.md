# 📊 System Resource Monitor
**Category:** Tools & Utilities | **Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Status:** 📋 Planned

---

## 📌 Overview
A real-time terminal dashboard showing CPU usage, RAM usage, disk space, and running processes — like a mini Task Manager in your console.

This project focuses on system-level programming and real-time terminal updates.

---

## ✨ Features
- Real-time CPU usage percentage
- RAM usage (used / total / free)
- Disk space monitoring
- Top running processes list
- Refresh rate control
- Alert when usage exceeds threshold
- Log resource usage to file
