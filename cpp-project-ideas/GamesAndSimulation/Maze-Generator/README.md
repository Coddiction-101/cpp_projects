# 🌀 Maze Generator & Solver

**Category:** Games & Simulations  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Status:** 📋 Planned  

---

## 📖 Overview

Generates random mazes using recursive backtracking and solves them using BFS and DFS pathfinding. Visualizes both the generation and solving process step by step in the terminal.
