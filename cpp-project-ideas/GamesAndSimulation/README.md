# 🎮 Games & Simulations

Fun, logic-heavy C++ projects that teach real-time input, game state management, AI algorithms, and simulation design. These projects are impressive, challenging, and genuinely enjoyable to build.

## 📈 Learning Path (Recommended Order)

```
Typing Speed Tester → Snake Game → Minesweeper
      → Maze Generator & Solver → Zombie Survival
            → Chess Engine
```

Start simple with Typing Tester (minimal new concepts), work up to Chess Engine (most complex).

## 🎯 Why Build Games?

- **Logic skills:** Games force you to think in states, conditions and edge cases
- **Real-time programming:** Keyboard input without Enter key is a rare skill
- **Algorithm practice:** Games naturally require sorting, searching and pathfinding
- **Fun factor:** You actually WANT to test your own project
- **Portfolio impact:** Games are the most visually impressive console projects
